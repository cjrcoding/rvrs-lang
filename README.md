🌊 Rivers (RVRS)"Not all contracts are code. Some are rivers."

RVRS is an experimental language for writing smart contracts on Cardano — not as commands, but as ceremony.It treats each contract as a ritual: structured, intentional, and flowing with meaning.

RVRS compiles to Aiken. It is still forming. Still flowing.

✨ The Core 6

The Core 6 shape every flow in RVRS:

flow: A ritual, a container of purpose

source: The origin of data, the spring

delta: A change, a transformation

branch: A decision, a fork in the current

mouth: A voice, a trace — the contract speaks

echo: The final word, the return, the reflection

These are the first stones in the riverbed.

🛠️ What Exists So Far

RVRS can now:

✅ Parse full flow declarations with typed parameters

✅ Recognize and handle empty or populated {} blocks

✅ Interpret mouth as a trace/logging statement

✅ Represent arguments, flows, and statements with real AST types

✅ Compile and run from .rvrs files via CLI

✅ Pretty-print the flow structure for human eyes

You can write this today:

flow bless(user: Identity) {
  mouth "welcome"
}

...and it becomes an AST ready to render into Aiken.

🌊 What’s Coming Next

echo: Return from a flow with intention

source / delta: Bind and transform values in ritual

branch: Flow logic through conditional currents

Expression support: variables, function calls, and comparison

Multi-flow files, test contracts, and on-chain rituals

As the language deepens, so does its capacity for ceremony.

🎨 Design Philosophy

RVRS is inspired by:

Ritual language and sacred geometry

Simplicity with soul

It will evolve with a defined color palette and world tone.

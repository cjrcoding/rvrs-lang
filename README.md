# rvrs-lang

🌊 **Rivers (RVRS)**  
*"Not all contracts are code. Some are rivers."*

**RVRS** is an experimental language for writing smart contracts as ceremony, transformation, and flow.

Built to compile to [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org), RVRS lets you write with intent, clarity, and rhythm.  
A language still forming, still flowing.

### ✨ The Core 6

The **Core 6** shape every flow in RVRS:

- `flow`: A ritual, a container of purpose  
- `source`: The origin of data, the spring  
- `delta`: A change, a transformation  
- `branch`: A decision, a fork in the current  
- `mouth`: A voice, a trace — the contract speaks  
- `echo`: The final word, the return, the reflection  

> These are the first stones in the riverbed.

### 🛠️ Status

RVRS is in early formation. Its syntax, compiler, and ideas are all taking shape.

> You’re welcome to follow the river, but not everything is shown at the surface.

🌊 **Rivers (RVRS)**  
*“Not all contracts are code. Some are rivers.”*

**RVRS** is an experimental language for writing smart contracts on Cardano — not as commands, but as ceremony.

It treats each contract as a ritual: structured, intentional, and flowing with meaning.

RVRS compiles to [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org), It is still forming. Still flowing.

## ✨ The Core 6

The **Core 6** shape every flow in RVRS:

- `flow`: A ritual, a container of purpose  
- `source`: The origin of data, the spring  
- `delta`: A change, a transformation  
- `branch`: A decision, a fork in the current  
- `mouth`: A voice, a trace — the contract speaks  
- `echo`: The final word, the return, the reflection  

> These are the first stones in the riverbed.

## 🛠️ What Exists So Far

RVRS can now:

- ✅ Parse full `flow` declarations with typed parameters  
- ✅ Recognize and handle empty or populated `{}` blocks  
- ✅ Interpret `mouth` as a trace/logging statement  
- ✅ Represent arguments, flows, and statements with real AST types  
- ✅ Compile and run from `.rvrs` files via CLI  
- ✅ Pretty-print the flow structure for human eyes

### 🧪 Example

You can write this today:

```rvrs
flow bless(user: Identity) {
  mouth "welcome"
}
```
…and it becomes an AST ready to render into Aiken.

🌊 What’s Coming Next
- echo: Return from a flow with intention

- source / delta: Bind and transform values in ritual

- branch: Flow logic through conditional currents

- Expression support: variables, function calls, and comparison

- Multi-flow files, test contracts, and on-chain rituals

As the language deepens, so does its capacity for ceremony.

🎨 Design Philosophy
RVRS is inspired by:

Ritual language and sacred geometry

Simplicity with soul

The belief that code can carry meaning, not just logic

It will evolve with:

A defined color palette

A calm visual tone

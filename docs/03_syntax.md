# 📜 RVRS Syntax Reference

*"Not all contracts are code. Some are rivers."*

This is the living syntax document for **RVRS**, a ceremonial, expressive language for writing smart contracts on Cardano. It outlines the current capabilities (as of `v0.9.0`) and previews functionality expected in the `v1.0` launch.

## 🌿 Core Rituals (Executable Essentials)

These are the minimum required to write working flows (functions) in RVRS:

| Keyword  | Meaning                           | Aiken Equivalent |
|----------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| `flow`   | Function definition / ritual      | `fn`             |
| `delta`  | Define or mutate a scoped variable| `let` / rebind   |
| `source` | Top-level constant definition     | `let` (const)    |
| `echo`   | Return a value from a flow        | `return`         |
| `mouth`  | Emit/log a value without halting  | `trace`          |
| `branch` | Conditional block                 | `if` / `else`    |
| `return` | (Alternative to `echo`, optional) | `return`         |

## 🧠 Type System (Enforced Constructs)

RVRS supports static typing via annotations (enforced in `v0.8.0+`):

```rvrs
delta x: Num = 5
flow identity(n: Num): Num {
  echo n
}
```

Supported base types:
* `Num`
* `Bool`
* `Str` *(enabled, expanding in v1.0)*
* `List[T]` *(planned)*

## 📦 Flow Composition (Calls & Modularity)

| Keyword                           | Meaning                        | Role in Execution        |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `call`                           | Invoke another flow            | Function call            |
| `return`                         | Exit with a value              | Return from flow         |
| `assert`                         | Require truth or halt          | Assertion guard          |
| `import`                         | Bring in external `.rvrs` flows| Module inclusion (v1)    |
| `@onchain`, `@mint`, `@view`     | Flow attributes                | Contract modes (planned) |

## 🕊️ Symbolic & Expressive Keywords *(Experimental / Future)*

These are poetic or expressive tools that may evolve post-v1:

| Keyword  | Meaning                      | Mapping / Status     |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| `veil`   | Optional or hidden logic     | `Maybe` / planned    |
| `tide`   | Iterate over a sequence      | `for` / planned      |
| `stream` | Represents a flowing list    | `List` / placeholder |
| `chant`  | Symbolic transformation      | Expr macro?          |
| `glyph`  | User-defined symbolic type   | `type` / long-term   |
| `ritual` | Named reusable block/module  | Planned              |

## 🪨 Structural & Meta Keywords

Used for constants, annotation, or symbolic structure.

| Keyword      | Meaning                    | Notes                    |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `pillar`     | Immutable constant         | `const`                  |
| `mark`       | Annotation or tag          | Could support metadata   |
| `drift`      | Halt flow early / fail     | `fail` / `error`         |
| `mouthpiece` | Conditional trace          | Planned                  |
| `echo_if`    | Conditional return         | Internal sugar           |

## 🧪 Syntax & Style Notes

### 🎨 Visual Identity *(Design Layer — Optional)*
* **Syntax Themes:** River-blue for flows, moss-green for branches, ink-black for deltas
* **Poetic Formatting:** Flows should be readable like ritual text or spells — indented with space to breathe
* **CLI Aesthetic:** Terminal colors based on type or keyword class (e.g. `delta` = blue, `echo` = white)

### 🔖 Annotations & Contracts
* Decorator-style flags like `@onchain`, `@mint`, `@test`, and `@view` are planned
* Future extensions may enable validator-type generation and compilation path control

### 📘 Icons/Glyphs (Docs Only)
* Use symbolic icons sparingly to emphasize ritual depth
* Example: `🌊` = `flow`, `🪨` = `pillar`, `🔀` = `branch` (for documentation only)

## ✅ Current Status:

RVRS v0.9.0 supports:
* Full `flow` and variable definition syntax
* Type annotations and type enforcement for expressions
* IR evaluation and test infrastructure
* Standard library merging at runtime
* Early integration with `Ya`'s recursive data structures
* Aiken transpilation examples for real-world mapping

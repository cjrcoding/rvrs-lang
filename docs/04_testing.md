# RVRS Testing Guide

Welcome to the test suite for RVRS — the Ritual Virtual River System. This guide outlines how tests are structured, where to find them, and how to run them.

## Folder Structure

All test files live under the `examples/` directory and are grouped by intent:

| Folder        | Purpose                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `core/`       | Fundamental language features (math, scope, delta, etc.)    |
| `edge_cases/` | Unexpected, invalid, or boundary-case behaviors             |
| `flows/`      | Flow invocation, arguments, return logic                    |
| `poetic/`     | Symbolic, expressive, or aesthetic RVRS patterns            |
| `regression/` | Full integration and coverage tests (`full_test.rvrs`)      |

## Running Tests

To run a single test file:

```bash
cabal run rvrs examples/core/math_test.rvrs
```

To run the full test suite:

```bash
cabal run RunAll
```

To run IR-level evaluations (internal flow logic):

```bash
cabal run RunIRTests
```

To run type system tests (expression-level typechecking):

```bash
cabal run TestTypeCheck
```


## Test Format

Each `.rvrs` file is a complete script and must contain a `flow main()` declaration.

RVRS will automatically evaluate the `main` flow in each test.

Expected forms of output and diagnostics:
* `echo` → returns a value and halts flow
* `mouth` → prints/logs a value (non-halting)
* `assert` → enforces truth, halts on failure
* `-- expect-fail` → marks a test expected to fail (e.g., type error)

Example:

```rvrs
flow main(): Num {
  delta x: Num = 4 * 2
  assert x == 8
  echo x
}
```

## Failure Reporting

* Type mismatches, undefined names, and assertion failures produce error messages
* Expected failures are tracked by `RunAll.hs` and `RunIRTests.hs`
* If a file marked `-- expect-fail` passes, the test fails intentionally
* If a file not marked `-- expect-fail` fails, the test fails genuinely
* Files can include notes like `-- expect: 42` to document expected values (planned)

## Best Practices

* Group tests logically and name descriptively
* Use `assert` to verify correctness
* Always include a `main` flow
* Prefer `echo` or `mouth` for clarity
* Mark failing tests explicitly with `-- expect-fail`
* Use the `regression/` folder for canonical feature sets

*"Tests in RVRS aren't just checks. They're affirmations — that each branch splits, each echo returns, and each flow holds."*

## 🧭 v0.3.0-alpha – Multi-Flow River Paths  
**Date:** 2025-04-28  
**Tag:** `v0.3.0-alpha`

### ✅ Summary:
RVRS now supports multiple `flow` blocks per file, with a formal entrypoint flow (`main`).  
Flows can call one another using `call <name>`, allowing modular logic structures.

### 🔨 Core Changes:
- Parser now accepts many flows from a single source file.
- `evalFlow` updated to receive a flow environment (`Map String Flow`) for linking.
- `Call` now exists as a **statement**, not an expression.
- Added support for empty argument lists in `flow()` declarations.
- `Main.hs` upgraded to build a flow map and run the `"main"` flow.

## 🧭 v0.2.0 – Flow Foundations  
**Date:** 2025-04-27  
**Tag:** `v0.2.0`

### ✅ Summary:
Core control flow in RVRS is now implemented and stable.  
The `mouth` keyword halts a flow immediately and optionally returns a value.

### 🔨 Core Changes:
- `Mouth` returns and halts the flow using `Returned` type.
- `evalBody` short-circuits on `Returned`.
- `Echo`, `Mouth`, and `Return` all unified under a clean result model.
- Added `formatVal` helper for consistent output.

## 🧭 v0.1.0 – First Watershed  
**Date:** 2025-04-25  
**Tag:** `v0.1.0`

### ✅ Summary:
Initial prototype of the RVRS interpreter.  
Supports basic expressions, flow blocks, echo statements, and evaluation.

### 🔨 Core Features:
- Parser and AST scaffolded with `Flow`, `Echo`, `Expr`, and simple arithmetic.
- Basic environment for variable handling with `source` and `delta`.
- First evaluator logic with runtime expression handling.

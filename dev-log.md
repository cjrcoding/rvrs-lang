ðŸ“˜ Dev Log Update
ðŸ§­ v0.3.1 alpha â€“ Scoped Variables & Shadowing
Date: 2025-04-29
Tag: v0.3.1

âœ… Summary:
RVRS now supports proper lexical scoping via a stacked environment model. Blocks like branch and call isolate their variables. Shadowing works, and the outer environment is restored after execution â€” laying the groundwork for parameterized flows and nested logic.

ðŸ”¨ Core Changes:

Converted Env to [Map String Binding] for stacked scope behavior

Implemented lookupVar, insertVar, and insertSource

Modified evalExpr, Delta, Source to respect scoped bindings

Updated Branch to push/pop scope and restore outer env

Patched Call to execute flows in isolated local scopes

Confirmed isolation: inner delta x = 2 does not overwrite outer x = 1

## ðŸ§­ v0.3.0-alpha â€“ Multi-Flow River Paths  
**Date:** 2025-04-28  
**Tag:** `v0.3.0-alpha`

### âœ… Summary:
RVRS now supports multiple `flow` blocks per file, with a formal entrypoint flow (`main`).  
Flows can call one another using `call <name>`, allowing modular logic structures.

### ðŸ”¨ Core Changes:
- Parser now accepts many flows from a single source file.
- `evalFlow` updated to receive a flow environment (`Map String Flow`) for linking.
- `Call` now exists as a **statement**, not an expression.
- Added support for empty argument lists in `flow()` declarations.
- `Main.hs` upgraded to build a flow map and run the `"main"` flow.

## ðŸ§­ v0.2.0 â€“ Flow Foundations  
**Date:** 2025-04-27  
**Tag:** `v0.2.0`

### âœ… Summary:
Core control flow in RVRS is now implemented and stable.  
The `mouth` keyword halts a flow immediately and optionally returns a value.

### ðŸ”¨ Core Changes:
- `Mouth` returns and halts the flow using `Returned` type.
- `evalBody` short-circuits on `Returned`.
- `Echo`, `Mouth`, and `Return` all unified under a clean result model.
- Added `formatVal` helper for consistent output.

## ðŸ§­ v0.1.0 â€“ First Watershed  
**Date:** 2025-04-25  
**Tag:** `v0.1.0`

### âœ… Summary:
Initial prototype of the RVRS interpreter.  
Supports basic expressions, flow blocks, echo statements, and evaluation.

### ðŸ”¨ Core Features:
- Parser and AST scaffolded with `Flow`, `Echo`, `Expr`, and simple arithmetic.
- Basic environment for variable handling with `source` and `delta`.
- First evaluator logic with runtime expression handling.

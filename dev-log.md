# RVRS Development Log

## Devlog Restart â€” April 28, 2025

**Context:**  
During restructuring and Git cleanup on April 27-28,  
previous dev logs were lost when an earlier version (v0.1.1) was accidentally pushed over the main repo.  
Local recovery succeeded â€” RVRS features were preserved and recommitted.

âœ… Full restoration completed.  
âœ… Project structure cleaned under `rvrs-lang/`.  
âœ… Progress tracking now restarted.

# RVRS Engine Tests

This is the **official test suite** for the `RVRS.Engine` evaluator, the recursive core of the RVRS language.

Each `.rvrs` file defines a top-level `flow main { ... }`, which is parsed, evaluated, and printed.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

- **`engine/`** â€“ All tests built on the new `RVRS.Engine` recursive evaluator
- **`legacy/`** â€“ Archived tests from earlier implementations (IR, Lower, old typechecker)

---

## How to Run

Run **all engine-based tests**:

```bash
cabal run runengine
```

Run **a specific file manually**:

```bash
cabal run rvrs tests/engine/basic_eval.rvrs
```

## Current Engine Tests

| File              | Purpose                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `basic_eval.rvrs` | Delta + Echo â€” minimal working sanity |
<!-- More tests will be added here -->

## ðŸ§± Testing Philosophy

> If itâ€™s not tested, itâ€™s not real.

RVRS treats tests as ritual and proof.

All new features â€” whether parser syntax, evaluator logic, or language constructs â€” **must be accompanied by tests** under the engine framework.  
We aim for clarity, confidence, and coverage at every layer.

## Legacy Tests (Archived)

Weâ€™ve moved all old tests into the `legacy/` folder, categorized as:

- `core/` â€“ Arithmetic, scoping, variable logic
- `typecheck/` â€“ Pass/fail tests for type enforcement
- `flows/` â€“ Higher-level user flows
- `edge_cases/` â€“ Unusual or extreme inputs
- `ir/` â€“ Legacy IR-based evaluation
- `syntax/` â€“ Validates surface syntax
- `regression/` â€“ Historical bugs and their fixed outputs
- `poetic/` â€“ Language-ritual tests using symbolic style
- `debug_test.rvrs` â€“ A freeform sandbox

Legacy tests will not be deleted, but they will **not be maintained or run** unless ported to the new engine system.
